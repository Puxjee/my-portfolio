        üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Melek ElMokhtar, a Full-Stack Web Developer passionate about
        turning complex ideas into elegant, user-friendly applications. With a
        background in Next.js, React, Node.js, and modern databases (PostgreSQL,
        MongoDB, Prisma), I enjoy building solutions that are not only scalable
        but also deliver real business impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        üí° I thrive at the intersection of frontend precision and backend
        performance. Whether it‚Äôs designing a responsive interface, implementing
        real-time dashboards, or developing secure APIs, I bring a full-stack
        approach that connects the dots between user experience and technical
        reliability.
        <br />
        <br />
        üåç My recent projects range from delivering a collaborative
        documentation portal (MVP in 12 weeks, Scrum) to creating an e-commerce
        platform with secure payments and stock management. These experiences
        sharpened my ability to solve problems quickly, manage priorities under
        pressure, and keep a positive, solution-oriented mindset.
        <br />
        <br />‚ú® What I bring:
        <ul>
